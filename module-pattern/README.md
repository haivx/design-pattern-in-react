<h2>Module Pattern: Split up your code into smaller, reusable pieces</h2>


1. Definitions:

- Besides being able to split your code into smaller reusable pieces, modules allow you to keep certain values within your file private. Declarations within a module are scoped (encapsulated) to that module , by default. 

- If we donâ€™t explicitly export a certain value, that value is not available outside that module. This reduces the risk of name collisions for values declared in other parts of your codebase, since the values are not available on the global scope.
