<h2>Observer Pattern: Use observables to notify subscribers when an event occurs</h2>

1. Definitions:

- With the observer pattern, we can subscribe certain objects, the observers, to other another object, called the observable. Whenever an event occurs, the observable notifies all its observers!

- An observable object usually contains 3 important parts:
    * observers: an array of observers that will get notified whenever a specific event occurs
    * subscribe():a method in order to add observers to theo bservers list
    * unsubscribe(): a method in order to remove observers from the observers list
    * notify():a method to notify all observers whenever as pecific event occurs

2. Example:

- First: Create Observable
```js
  class Observable {
    constructor () {
      this.observer = []
    }

    subscribe(func) {
      this.observer.push(func);
    }

    unSubscribe(func) {
      this.observer = this.observer.filter(subscribe => subscribe !== func)
    }

    notify(data) {
      this.obsevers.forEach(observer => observer(data))
    }
  }

  export default new Observable()
```
- Using in component:
```js
  import { ToastContainer, toast } from "react-toastify"

  function logger(data) {
    console.log(data)
  }

  observable.subscribe(logger)

  function App() {
    function handleClick() {
      observable.notify('User clicked button!')
    }

    return (
      <div>
        <Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</Button>
      </div>
    )
  }

```

Whenever a user interacts with either of the components, both the logger function will get notified with the data that we passed to the notify method!

`Although we can use the observer pattern in many ways, it can be very useful when working with asynchronous, event-based data. Maybe you want certain components to get notified whenever certain data has finished downloading, or whenever users sent new messages to a message board and all other members should get notified.`

3. Advantages and disadvantage

- Advantages: 
    * Using the observer pattern is a great way to enforce separation of
concerns and the single-responsiblity principle. 
    * The observer objects arenâ€™t tightly coupled to the observable object, and can be (de)coupled at any time. The observable object is responsible for monitoring the events, while the observers simply handle the received data.

- Disadvantages:
    * If an observer becomes too complex, it may cause performance issues when notifying all subscribers.
