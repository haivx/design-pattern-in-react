<h2>Container/Presentatinal Pattern: Enforce separation of concerns by separating the view from the application logic</h2>

This pattern is very familiar with React Dev:

1. `Presentational Components`: Components that care about how data is shown to the user. In this example, that's the rendering the list of dog images.

2. `Container Components`: Components that care about what data is shown to the user. In this example, that's fetching the dog images.
